 NEWS for uuid
---------------

1.1-0	2022-04-19
    o	added UUIDparse() and UUIDvalidate() functions

    o	added an internal representation of UUIDs as
	class "UUID" which represents a vector of 128-bit
	elements interpreted as UUIDs. This also allows seamless
	conversion between textual representation, raw vectors and
	UUID objects.


1.0-5	2022-04-19
    o	update to upstream util-linux version e928e8ed6

    o	add LinkingTo includes in the source tree. This fixes issues
	on Windows where the headers were not copied since configure
	is not run on Windows. The headers can be updated using
	src/update-inst.sh script in the source tree.


1.0-4	2022-03-15
    o	Windows: use dynamic buffer when querying DLLs to
	avoid "Too many DLLs" error.


1.0-3	2021-11-01
    o	guard flock() with HAVE_FLOCK for platforms that
	don't have it


1.0-2	2021-10-25
    o	silence benign sendfile warning from upstream


1.0-1	2021-10-20
    o	update to latest upstream libuuid sources
	(util-linux c4a543ff, libuuid e6743239)

    o	Add LinkingTo: API allowing other packages to
	use UUID generation from C code


0.1-4	2020-02-26
    o	add `n' parameter to UUIDgenerate() to generate
	multiple UUIDs at once (#2)

    o	use crypto-safe RNG on Windows to avoid UUIDs
	that are identical. That makes the default behavior
	equivalent to `use.time=FALSE' on Windows. (#8)


0.1-3	2020-02-25
    o	don't use deprecated `R CMD config CPP`

    o	isolate rand()/srand() to avoid warnings


0.1-2	2015-07-27
    o	update License entry to conform to CRAN rules

    o	don't break on systems without flock()
	(thanks to Brian Ripley)


0.1-1	2013-09-03
    o	initial CRAN release


0.1-0	2013-02-24
    o	initial version based on libuuid
